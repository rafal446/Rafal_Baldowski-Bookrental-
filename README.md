# Rafal_Baldowski-Bookrental-
In the project I used my current skills in programming, testing, creating test reports. The tested page can be found at https://ta-bookrental-fe.onrender.com/. The application backend was tested using Postman. For the frontend part I wrote tests in Java using Selenium. I adopted the Page Object Model and the Singleton pattern. I generate test reports using the Allure library.
